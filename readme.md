#### Latest Changes - Waiting for approval  31/7/2019:
At the moment the files shared are only for complement the NANOPHLOW report and showing the structure of the tool. 
Soon and under the approval of S. Ramirez we will put all the files necessary to be used by the public.

#### Demonstration of the diffusiophoresis tool:
The first step is creating the geometry. An example study of the force applied on a polymer starting from various configurations after equilibration. This is a full OOP paradigm which is built in python language and binds with LAMMPS.  
Feeding the parameters in a “study” object and then running an equilibrium and/or force calculation simulations. Currently, it is demonstration of the structure. Dependancy files will be uploaded soon.
